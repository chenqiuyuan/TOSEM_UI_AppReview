162006791,22416,com.etrade.mobilepro.activity,3.0,2015-04-09,User interface is clunky,Overall the app works as advertised but leaves lots of room for improvement. The UI is clunky and some of the elements take up a lot of space. The dashboard should be configurable to pick elements you want to see. Also to use most of the features in the app you need to be logged on. For whatever reason you can't stay logged on for more than 30 minutes. The app should make more features available without a full logon.,,,Kevin Finnigin,1

151314184,51602,udk.android.reader,1.0,2013-09-09,Buggy Slow Inefficient,I was hoping to use this to take notes on PDF slides (of powerpoints) for classes. The trial version seemed okay at a quick test so I bought the full version.  As soon as I started using the full version it suddenly told me I couldn't make changes to the PDF's any more. It gives me an error Failed to Save Document when I try to save a copy with the notes/markups. I can't find any resolution too this error so it just means that the app is rendered non-functional. This is incredibly frustrating since it worked in the Trial version. I paid money for the app to stop working. Great. Next applying markups or notes is tedious. There is no eraser function for a stylus you have to either undo it or delete the whole batch of lines and start over. Adding notes or markups is slow and frequently crashes the app.  All in all this has only proven to be a PDF viewer with no further functionality for me. Why anyone would pay for such a simple viewer when you can get better ones for free is beyond me.,,,A Google user,0

97601608,15937,com.astrodean.notelynxpro,4.0,2012-10-12,...well actually 4 & 1/2 stars...,The only negative comment is that I don't consider this intuitive at all. I'm still struggling to adapt the conventions and usage protocols to what I've been used to with other programs apps etc. HOWEVER; that being said this is a far more flexible and useful outliner -like app than any other one out there. It does all of the things that normal outlining apps do except that it adds some additional functionalities that convert it into more than just an outliner app. The biggie is the ability to link almost any branch to almost any other branch at any location. This means you can create outlines as large as as complex as you want and still be able to see the big picture simultaneously with working with the detail view. With just a little creative thinking you can then turn this app into a task manager to-do list long-range planning tool inventory tool status-tracker etc. etc. The other goodie is the ability to format the text of the notes with things like bold italics bullets etc. Not only does this make it customizable to the individual but it supports the ability to do more than just outlining by allowing further distinguishing between branches.

Showed a picture of Trevor and the answer was Grand Theft Auto... no V. If you're going to be specific then be specific as Grand Theft Auto is a different game to Grand Theft Auto V. Trevor wasn't in Grand Theft Auto. Same thing with the image of Leon as the answer was Resident Evil - but Leon wasn't in Resident Evil he was in the sequels though. Most of the images are like this. Shows an image from a specific game - but the answer does not correspond to that image.,Totally agree with you. We are continually updating the game to adapt the titles to the user average knowledge. If we keep some specific titles and in others we only request the saga name is because a percentage of people use to stuck in this titles. Hope it's not too much annoyance for you.,2017-12-12,Steve Perrin,1

It pauses frequently because it does not buffer enough. It gets stuck all the time with videos going out of sync with audio. It does correct itself though. The biggest problem is you can't just close it. If you don't back out to the home screen the next time you open it the video will run without controls.

108374913,42976,com.urbandroid.lux.donate,4.0,2017-04-01,,I use this app every night & I really like it. My one issue is the dimmer setting to make my screen darker (while also being darker orange) doesn't get dark enough and I have to use a separate dimming app to achieve my desired results. I like my screen dark and barely emitting light at the wee hours in the morning I'm going to bed- like I was reading by a candle that was burning out- or how the sunset turns into the pitch black darkness of night (or close to that). So if you add a darker setting with the amber color that is almost pitch black/orange I'll give you the fifth star! But still I love the app and I wouldn't be able to sleep well without it =^),Many thanks for your valuable feedback. We are unfortunately unable to react to all of the reviews on Google Play Store.

167608097,44481,com.worms3.app,2.0,2014-12-04,Great gameplay glitchy interface,Once you get into a game it works flawlessly but there are a number of other problems before then: 1) Fairly often when I start the game it simply crashes at the loading screen. 2) The main screen allows you to tap interface buttons while it's still loading but simply ignores these taps until it's ready. 3) If you play an online game and return to the game select screen tapping a different game will appear to select a different game to play but actually still has the previous game selected. You have to wait until it's finished loading and tap that game again otherwise you're entering your previous game in spectator mode. 4) I can't find a way to change my online name. I've emailed Team 17 twice about these issues and haven't heard back from them.,Good afternoon Dennis  We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing these issues.

159242572,57805,dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full,1.0,2012-09-22,Be aware of its limitations !!!!!! Disappointed.,Imagine a situation: you have the same files on your SD card and your cloud service provider like Dropbox but with some timestamp difference (many reasons for that). How it will work in case of Dropsync ? It will simply work it will notice that all the files are the same and that's it. And in case of FolderSync ? You can forget about it you need to redownload/reupload all your files otherwise you will get 'conflicting modifications' errors !!! It sounds like a joke but it works like that. Besides that it has some huge problems with instant uploads and auto syncing - sometimes it's not working or gets into autosync loop when it keeps syncing the same folder in 1 minute intervals despite 1 hours autosync interval set. I really don't understand the logic behind some of its actions. This file manager is also very irritating I'm not sure what is this for as I have never used it but it is very poor and is run at start by default. The UI is also one big misunderstanding very unintuitive. Sync is also slower than in Dropsync. Overall I'm really disappointed and I recommend Dropsync if you use Dropbox. It has less features but is much more stable faster predictible and intelligent.,,,A Google user,0

101406644,25370,com.google.android.webview,3.0,2018-09-26,,An actual review to interrupt all of the wonderful meme reviews. This loses points for requiring so much work to enable instead of Chrome gotta disable Chrome which is built in to so many ROMs hope nothing re-enables it and then enjoy a tiny bit less RAM usage because bloated Chrome isn't running in the background. That's really all this is for. Running instead of Chrome whenever an app displays a web wrapper. Or your phone pulls up a webpage to ask you to log in to Wi-Fi. Normally it loads Chrome up without most of the interface and just shows the pages there. This is what Android used to use before 7.0. If you want to try it for yourself if and only if you use a browser other than Chrome normally just disable it in its App Info screen. WebView should enable automatically and then you should update it here. Oh and for some reason this thing defragmented all of my mechanical storage dusted my furniture and folded my laundry. Can't explain that.,,,Abdelfattah Nimer,1

But its located in japan so it is understandable. you end up spending a lot of money on trying to win a prize because normally you can't just play once and win you have to usually knock a prize into the hole so you have to play over and over moving it closer and closer until you win and the crane is extremely weak! I havent seen it really pick anything up honestly. I did win a large plush though I spent about 50-60 bucks trying to do this. It's addicting like gambling so play at your own risk.

109750996,46746,hd.camera.photo.gallery.editor,2.0,2018-03-10,,I wanted was a tool that could focus correctly in low light. My new xiaomi mi max 2 camera has middling specs especially compared to the overall hardware quality but it doesn't even deliver middling performance. Meanwhile this app was revelatirt. I could read every word on a printed page sitting on my desk in the semi dark. Major score .... much better than the custom port i tried of google pixel camera which would have been good enough except performance was buggy. As for the ads: they are not terrible and what's more you get the app ad free for watching five brief videos. Four were 30 secs. One was 60 seconds. I would have paid for it had there been such an option so I am glad there wasn't. Three minutes time for this app is a steal! Excited to check out the featured and curious why it focuses this well. I have tried tons of camera appspaid and free that don't even come close. PS Why do developers who create camera and gallery apps persist in identifying said apps as simply 'camera' and 'gallery' to the Android OS? Guys don't you realize this makes it impossible to choose your app to be the system default or even differentate when we are faced with a choice of apps to 'open with'?,,,Amy Pagnozzi,1

Like this review if u agree! Edit: the free Puffin web browser is officially the best web browser for mobile! Puffin has a flash player of its own & it has great features such as a mouse with an onscreen trackpad a button to let you manually open the keyboard (especially helpful when the keyboard doesn't pop up when it should) a bar that stays above the keyboard with buttons such as 'select all' 'copy' 'paste' & 'cut' as well as a 'gamepad' which isn't very useful or functional and needs some work but u can assign any key on a physical keyboard including arrows to the buttons of the gamepad.,,,Nice Person,0

123944739,54731,com.langqi.myshoppingmall,5.0,2018-11-30,,There are elements of this game that I like over Design Home. For example the voting process on this game is more fair. In Design Home it makes you choose between 2 designs and whichever design you have chosn that score goes up and the other score goes down. Which isn't fair when both designs are equally good. If you chose to no vote for either both scores go down. In this game you see one design at a time and either dislike or like it. The person's score then goes either up or down based on the vote. Also when you vote in Design Home you earn keys but it maxes out at 75. So there is no insensitive to keep voting until you need more keys. In this game you just purchase the hearts you need. Voting is not a requirement I do it because I want my designs voted on so it seems fair to vote on other designers.,,,A Google user,1

188581332,20870,com.disney.clubpenguinremix_goo,4.0,2018-03-12,,I'm not gonna rate this game compared to the old one but as a stand alone Game it's ok the controls are pretty good the stories aren't really anything special. The chat is very improved but it's way too censored I tried to ask someone to come do a dance battle with me and it was censored. So I don't really like that. Now the clothes creator is really neat very easy to use and allows your penguin to be very customizable. The addition of Disney clothes that you can buy from the start is great however I feel like they should've had more classic characters such as Mickey mouse Disney princesses now granted there are some Disney princesses but not a lot you only see the latest additions such as tangled and frozen no classics. As for the membership it's reasonable but a little pricey imo I could see $3/mo not $5/mo. As for the island itself it's nothing special there's not many places to go not much to do. It can get very boring. Now I know I said that I wouldn't judge this game based on the original but I need to say one thing it's no excuse to cancel the original. The original was 100 better. Just had to get that out. I think that about wraps up everything. Thanks for reading.,,,A Person,1

Downloads have only shown errors now and no longer download because of songs stuck in the queue (no way to access what is/isn't downloading to cancel because an error screen shows now).  Original review: Great app have been a napster/rhapsody customer for years now. Two things could use improvement for five stars: Would like for mobile downloaded playlists to automatically add individual songs to library and for Bluetooth to push through artist and song titles when connected to cars (been in several cars and only song name gets pushed through to in-car dashboard).,,,Christine Vu,1

Problem is you do have to fight the same battles way too many times. And there doesn't seem to be any point in starting over. It also has display issues: 1. There needs to be an option to display X significant digits using abbreviations e.g. 10M instead of 1000000 - carefully counting digits and watching numbers dance as they change their number of decimal places gets tiresome really fast. 2. Numbers overlap with text sometimes making them totally unreadable. 3. Number text gets *really* tiny sometimes. It's not really made for small screens (!),,,Christopher Wood,1

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the pricing. They too push the annual over the monthly pricing and the latter is expensive. I mean if they can lower the annual cost to $39.96 that'd be $3.33 a month then why's the actual monthly price still at $9.99?,Hi Thanks for giving a try to Drops and sending us feedback!

103896009,31713,com.mightypocket.grocery.full,5.0,2012-10-12,Brilliant shopping app for Android,Coming to Android from a Nokia with Symbian was a slight culture shock and it took me a while to find a shopping app which worked as well as the Symbian one I'd been using for a year or so. I trawled through so many Droid shopping apps I was almost going to give up and resort to pencil and scraps of paper. Then I discovered Mighty Grocery Lite . At first it seemed a bit over the top for a simple shopping list but as I became used to it and found my way around I got to the point where I just couldn't do without it. Some of the features are not available in the Lite version and I had got to the point where the extras would be really nice so I bought the full version. I wasn't disappointed and in retrospect would have paid much more for this app. I'm still learning all it's ins and outs (thanks to the in depth user guide on their site) and as yet haven't found anything I would like it to do that it doesn't already do. The recipe function is a real blast. Want Moroccan lamb Tagine tonight? Go to the recipe section (which you will have already filled in with the ingredients) - select all and there they are in your current shopping list - outstanding. I HIGHLY recommend this,,,A Google user,0

I believe they should take away the ability for us to take away ratings the way we do. I find that just because some change is made and it's not instantly fixed people come here immediately just to harass the developers. Everyone can make a mistake this person has to work on an App that will get tried on devices I'm certain they do not own or have access to. Because there are so many different Android devices. This is the ONLY reason apps on the App Store with Apple are better they only have ONE device to worry about. Devs here have it harder as they have several!

Can you post a screen shot of how the new ads are positioned?,Hi there is a banner and 1 full screen ad (no video) every 5 mins of usage. In order to keep the app 100% free with unlimited usage and continue to implement improvements we added this small amount of ads to the free version.

This happened multiple times and was very aggravating. It will be more user friendly if you confirm that you want to delete what was just typed and also move the discard changes button in a spot where it can't be accidentally hit. I'm very close to switching to another project management tool because of this. Needs to be fixed.,Roy I want to let you know that we pushed an update to Basecamp 3 that fixes typing on Android.

It does exactly the things I'd like it to. It has a wonderful UI and never bugs out (at least for me on the LG G4). I think a few features are left desired however. Specifically customization. I like that we have a few themes to choose from and then the ability to make our own but I'd like the ability to make the playlist art whatever image I want like in Spotify. I'd also like for more organization customization like choosing what tab to default to and how playlists are organized. I don't like having to scroll through my playlists rather than just seeing and using the most recent ones show up at the top of I'm making playlists.

I only bank with credit unions and when I put my information in it gave me an error message. I tried to retrieve with a different account and it would not scan the cards etc. I called Zelle to find out why I was receiving the error message and I was transferred to the 2nd level tech peopl (Well that's what I was told). I sat waiting for 50 minutes and no one ever picked up the call. Music and advertisements played the entire time. The next morning I tried again and another 30 minutes on hold no one answered etc. I had them on speaker as I waited for them to answer. No clue no answers and for this reason not impressed. Zelle is garbage as far as I am concerned and should have just stated that they weren't doing business with a number of banking institutions as of now. Fir tjis reason stop allowing people to send their $ if the recipients aren't going to be able to receive the funding due to not banking with specific banks. Oh..one of my credit unions is a well...known CU that military members and their families utilized. Very reputable CU. So this was perplexing.
