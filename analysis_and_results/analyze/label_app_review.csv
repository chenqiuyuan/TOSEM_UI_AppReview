It's Bluetooth connected to the stereo and I use it for navigate music podcasts radio audio books and all sorts so when my media is constantly interrupted by this app it gets very old. 2) Then I have to swipe from the left scroll down tap menu tap settings tap general scroll down tap turn off sound.

What I don't like is when you add in a wall to a room none of the objects click onto it like they do to the room walls making it difficult to place things. I also would like some kind of landscaping tools to layout an outside area or a back porch.,All the symbols should snap to interior walls created with the Walls icon.

97679341,16117,com.autodesk.homestyler,1,2018/9/27,,I'll give it 5 stars if you can correct the following: 1. I wish I can save my work reopen and edit then save again multiple times WITHOUT the image quality progressively degrading. 2. I wish the catalogue would always ALWAYS load ALL items completely. For example: I select ceiling lights and only half of them load. I have to constantly go to another menu then come back just to test if the item list is improved. Or I keep scrolling up and down to trigger the rest of the list to load. Time and energy wasted. 3. Detecting corners/straightness of walls need serious improvement. I wish I can use my own room templates without the 3D grid being crooked. Can't even adjust slanted corners... 4. I wish the full kitchen sets won't leave gray outlines on walls and floors when I remove them. 5. I wish there were more room templates for bathroom kitchen.. Most templates are for living rooms. 6. Categorizing and displaying the items need improvement. For example: the Office - Accessories menu doesn't show all the books varieties. While the Living Room - Books and Magazines doesn't show all magazines... Same goes with Art and Posters vs. Paintings/Photographs. Finding stuff got my head spinning...lol 7. When you accidentally swipe an item off the screen there's no way to drag it back into view. 8. There's an UNDO option for editing walls and floors but not for anything else I find it necessary like when you accidentally shift an item already perfectly placed.. 9. Speaking of editing walls.. I do a bit of layering on them sometimes.. It would be so much easier if multiple layers can be applied in one go. Plus there should be a way to reset a wall to its original even after approving changes because when you edit walls you can't see if it goes well with the furniture. Either add a reset option or make the furniture visible... Honestly I'm super addicted to this app that I persevere through all the glitches. But I wish my experience using it will be a completely positive one instead of it feeling like a tedious chore.

I work on getting them connected at a start of a ride. And I do mean work they no not simply connect when near a bluetooth enabled and configured cell phone. I use a dedicated Android Nexus 5 cell phone with the wi-fi and cell turned off. If I stop riding to take a short break 3-5 minutes the phone stays on the bike. They will not connect/ link when riding resumes.  The online direction on the wahoo site are not clear no not match the app and do not have up to date screen shots. DIrection for android and Apple to be completely separate as the apps appear to be seperate. The sensors newly purchased and have up to date firmware. What a waste of money for the sensors  I have used three different versions of the product. I am using the current version 1.10.5.3. The problems with the Bluetooth reconnection is still a problem. I have tested the product on a different phone running android 7.0 and still have same problems The support group writes nice email bur can not get the problem fixed. I can not recommend Wahoo products.,Hey Frederick thanks for the feedback.

116317161,13844,com.acorns.android,1,2018/11/26,,Update: 10/26/2018 - there have now been 3 or 4 updates since the original change to how round ups are managed and the Acorns people still don't get it. I lowered my score to 1 star now - originally from 5 before they made the change. You still can only see two transactions at a time. Automatic round ups aren't on since you may get a transaction rounded up twice - once when it's pending and another when it cleared. Because of this I manually select my round ups. Now only being able to see two they may both be pending and therefore I don't select but can't look at other transactions. They keep saying they're listening to our comments but no change yet. I'll give them one or two more updates to correct. If not then I'll be closing the account. I had rated this app a 5 until some braniac decided to remove the feature that made it so good - Round Ups. Now I can only see two transactions at a time with no description. I don't want to auto round up. Please bring back the ability to see all transactions and select which to round up from their own screen. Update on 11/25/18 - Acorns still hasn't made improvements to the round ups feature. You still can only see 2 available round ups to select. If those transactions are showing as pending we need to be able to skip or ignore them in order to select and round up transactions that have already cleared. Other wise many transactions will get rounded up twice - once when pending and another when cleared. If automatic round ups is turned on then that's exactly what happens - two rounds up for the same one transaction.,Hi there we appreciate your thoughts. At this time customers may only select the pre-populated spare change on the action feed.

The ability to swipe left/right to travel through time is great! The widgets are great: freely resizable. It was just what I needed. Some suggestions for the author: * The DeltaTemp display was not obvious at first. After I found out what it was I was sold on it. But I had to dig to find out what it was showing me. Perhaps some on-boarding tour of the app or an about screen for each graph (for example  sun dogs  monkeys wedding  etc are not self-explanitory) would help. * I was about to write about all the different things I would like to customize about the graphs. Then I found information about the graph editor on your website. This should satisfy all my requests. But you can do a better job at selling how cool the premium features are! I really had to dig around to figure it out.,Wow a super long review. Thanks Mike. I agree our help needs improvement. It's a balance between being educational and too intrusive.

18350799,1908,com.ebay.mobile,1,2018/3/22 0:00,,Does not have similar item function. Search function show nothing related to the current item. Bad. Earlier version 2.6.12 has this option. Why can't the developers just include the earlier function into the new ui. Now they are forcing to upgrade to the new app. Older version works better for searching with its functions.

10850028,1908,com.ebay.mobile,1,2018/4/11 0:00,,Update to the update the search function has gotten progressively worse. Since users can't bebrelied upon to accurately input the data fields sometimes a search is necessary to find an item. Now when searching a subcategory it doesn't filter to within the subcategory and takes you out to a search of all of ebay. You then have to use the filters to take you to the category. So a search that took 10 seconds on very 3.0.0.19 now takes ten times that. Worse yet you can't even use 3.0.0.19 anymore because it is unsupported. The app is now catering to the business interests over the users. Please call and ask that they bring back 3.0.0.19 and end this failed experiment at cramming paid suggestions down our throats. Or better yet let's just sell our things on a less frustrating platform like getting held up at gunpoint on a Craigslist or letgo deal. Update still awkward and filled with more suggestions. They now have moved the filter or even taken it away for some categories. If i am browsing and select a category I want to search within that category not a search throughout all of eBay.  I thought my earlier displeasure with the app was as bad as it could get. I'm sure now they will only find more ways to make browsing worse and more awkward. Newest version still fails to allow you to search within a category without clicking the filter button. Mainly this is an annoyance but it shows how poorly streamlined the new ui is. The layout is not intuitive and finding your followed searches your watched items or your purchases is no longer readily available at the home screen and requires menu opening. The one handed thoughtless operation has been replaced with useless suggestions of things you'd never want to buy so they can cram some advertising revenue on top of the tithe they extract from your sales.,,,A Google user,others,others,comparative review,comparative review,,,1

100947358,24341,com.gamelounge.chroomakeyboard,3,2018/9/7,,I really want to like this keyboard. It's certainly attractive and I love the adaptive colors. However I use swipe to type and while it does work it just isn't as accurate or as intuitive as Gboard. Certain words while swiping are difficult to get because there are several options for the swipe pattern and this keyboard doesn't offer useful alternate suggestions. For example while trying to swipe Tom it might input Tim but not offer Tom as a quick tap alternative even though the i and o are right next to each other. Gboard does. Also there are some bugs that are crippling. You can't input numbers into a gif search for some reason and swiping left or right on the space bar to move the texting cursor in a gif search brings up a text select UI that completely covers the text and cursor making it useless. Hopefully this is all addressed in future updates.,Thank you for your feedback! do you have any suggestion in order to make our app a    app?

People can ruin anything - it isn't the app mainly the mamas on there that I wish would just go away. Too many selfies with annyoing filters too many mamas complaining about this and that - not enough mom and kid content. There was a chick I made a joke to about how she LIVES in the app (Brooke) which is true and she blew up and cursed me out and blocked me - most of these moms have NO sense of humor and they want to do is complain and cry on the app and it is depressing af.

Her and other mom I spoke to took down all their photos of themselves and their child and pretty much don't go on the app anymore which sucks because I would like to meet with more moms but if they're getting turned off because one of these super moms are aggressive about posting things in the right place or reminding everyone to say the right things to be sensitive to other moms.

187687,109542803,ep3.littlekillerz.ringstrail,2,2017/3/4 0:00,,I'm going to start by saying this game IS WORTH THE DOLLAR. buy it try it very well written it's fun to read through. If this was a choose-your-own-adventure game easy five star. However it is not the combat aspect and gameplay ruin this game. To elaborate I played this game non-stop got my characters to a collective level of six and six party members all party members are fully equipped all their skills that utilize individually are level 4. I use blessed curse case I match the proper elements to the proper monster and yet at this point Random Encounters kill my entire party with ease. Perhaps it is because every companion found is a magic user or Archer because there is no way to have any freedom with who you hire into your party you just have to hope for the best. Gold is so scarce you have to choose between training skills or better equipment or having enough transportation for food drink and required first. I spent the last 4 hours going from place to place trying to locate anything that can help my characters Advanced thinking maybe I just hit a dry spot or rough patch that is not the case. This difficulty by attrition approach to the game makes it almost impossible to enjoy since it already is extremely slow in the sense of its Oregon Trail ask movement which is a great concept if it were not so difficult to actually handle the encounters. And speaking of encounters the skill system is extremely lopsided in the sense that you barely ever succeed despite having 10 of 10 of your skills which by the way also called build the train and has no chance of increasing unless you pay. This all adds up to a grinding aspect of the game where you walk back and forth between two cities or between cities with Fighters Guild and Mage guild quests which range from two types laughably easy to Impossible. If that wasn't enough to make it almost unplayable when you actually get to town even a simple trip to the chapel can end in a dragon attack which is an instant party wife since you can't even hit the Dragon because your characters are not ready to fight a dragon. This crawling pace and just terrible system of attrition reloading restarting and basically Forced Gameplay makes me want to delete this game and move on because it is just so disappointing when it started out so promising. I will however give it one more shot and roll a fighter class to allow me to maybe enjoy the game even though it's taking away my choyce I will update and edit this if I find a redeemable and just got a terrible playthrough and it's just the way it is but I feel as though the game is disjointed at best.,,,James Choyce,experience,experience,accessibility,accessibility,,值得,0

111412749,51600,uk.co.aifactory.go,3,2017/2/25,,Serious scoring bugs. The app uses the score estimator as the final scoring tool. If the final territory is large the score estimator will omit a few points of territory. This often leads to the computer missing out on a few points. Also the estimator/final score does not handle some seki correctly. If one color completely surrounds another then the inner group is considered dead even though it's seki. Finally the AI plays very poorly when lossing. It will not resign so you have to finish a nonsensical game to the very end or abandon the match.,Thank you the report. We will introduce a much more accurate scoring system in an update in the near future. If the cpu believes it cannot win it may make poor moves as all moves lose.

But like many such apps its shutter buttons on the screen are designed only for right handed people. I want to hold the phone horizontal in my right hand and press the shutter button with my left hand. As it is I have to reach awkwardly across the screen for that (or use the physical volume button). So - any chance of a setting which would put the shutter buttons on the left side instead of the right side for those who prefer that? I suspect that would be fairly easy to implement. Cheers! Edit - having seen the developer reply I am deeply embarrassed. It's never occurred to me to rotate a phone to get the buttons under my left hand. Old world thinking by me! Thanks for quick response. Six stars.,All you need to do is rotate the phone clockwise and the shutter buttons will be on the left.

It scans well though at the end of the day that depends on your camera too the app aligns the scans up perfectly and the OCR tool works well though expect to do some formatting obviously. It's really worth the upgrade though you'll only need a premium account if you do a lot of scanning I use this mostly for important personal documents. It's easy to share the created PDFs via email. The UI is neat and easy to understand. My old review follows the way to get rid of the icon is a bit obscure just saying.  There is no reason for this icon to be displayed with all the other apps that have a separate licence app the icon disappears once activated. Why doesn't the camscanner licence icon disappear? Lazy programming! The main app is OK I'm not saying don't buy it this is just a note to the developers. ,Hi Marcel sorry for the confusion. One of the two icons can be hidden like this: click the upper left 'CS' icon of the main document list in the free app- Settings- Help- Hide Icon.

96515949,12265,ch.icoaching.wrio,4,2016/6/3,,Just bought this keyboard today and I have a few thoughts. 1) Aesthetically it's great. Love the bigger keys love the hexagonal design and I love the colors. Great job on eye candy. 2) I'll come back and adjust my review in a couple of weeks but the learning curve is steep since I'm now looking for letters in different places. Being dialed in to three rows of keys moving to 4 is a challenge. But with time I'm sure I'll adjust. Maybe it's not so much of a learning curve on how to use it as it is learning new placement. 3) The swipe up for capitalization is pretty cool but it can get a little tricky when using punctuation. I do wish WRIO would swap the apostrophe for the exclamation point. Since apostrophes and quotes are used above letters in writing my brain wants to swipe up for both. I think a press and hold for exclamation and swipe up for both apostrophe and quotes (hold and swipe for quotes) makes more sense. Overall I think it's a cool app. I look forward to getting used to it especially since I have fat thumbs. :),Hi Christopher. Thanks a lot for your feedback. :) 2. Yes it needs a bit of re-learning but as soon as you know the new positions you type very fast. 3.

111578325,52095,za.co.sabirding,5,2015/10/18,,We have of course to applaud the arrival of any birding app in Android since most of them were only available for iOS until recently (a weird fact since Android has 80% of users). This app is of course very good and provides everything a birder would need. The moronic faults of extreme license check and limit of two devices have been corrected and so it deserves nothing less than 5 stars (and rest assured if those critical faults ever return I will change my review to 1 star). However I expect some other minor faults to be corrected in future editions: Scrolling of the pictures should be circular you shouldn't have to scroll all the way back to the bird drawing once you have reached the last photograph; some sounds are corrupt and won't play at least in my device (eg Eurasian Bittern); the field guide pictures should be zoomable (would help a lot those of us who use the app on a phone); bird sounds provide a time index explaining the different recordings in the sound file but there is no visible timer to show the seconds elapsed; you can't browse the text or view the photos of a bird while listening to its sounds; etc. I hope these will be corrected in future versions.,Given the exceptional functionality and data content your few minor faults merely illustrate what an amazing app it is. You will also find that it is the small speaker on your device that is corrupting the sounds.

97314165,14941,com.anthonymandra.rawdroidpro,5,2014/8/17,Great App,Have used for viewing my raw images off my Nixon D7100 and it works great on my Samsung Note. Unfortunately with the kit kat bug a few issues have cropped up. Android will now prevent you from using USB cards with 3rd party apps. I tested this extensively using multiple devices. As soon as you upgrade to kit kat the app gets a few bugs. It is harder to get the app to gain access to the card at times also mass imports sometimes fail because the OS ejects the external USB. Likewise sometimes trying to save or view thumbnails can be spotty. It is not the card or the app. Have identical setup on lower android version that works flawless with same USB card and images. It is also random but can be worked around. While android will try to lock out USB cards from being accessed by the app you can simply use the file manager within android itself and batch move the images to the device and once there rawdroid takes over and works like a champ. This app makes it super easy to edit my camera images wherever I am and I don't need to be near a PC or drag a laptop around. Works great in conjunction with dslrdashboard. Keep up the good work.,Your detailed review covers a lot of the headaches I started investigating right before I moved.

Units are described as good at killing X but no way to quantify what good means.  3c. Units are researchable based on a point system but how do you know what unit to buy if you don't know how good it is (see 3b) 4. To take over a large building (after clearing it out) it can take literally 13 minutes with a solider or 6.5 minutes with a scout. Multiple troops lower this time but its still painfully slow.

An example of what I call a quirk: to get to Settings you have to go back to the main menu...the usual (Android-standard) settings button at the bottom of the phone does nothing. Also--and this is NOT a criticism--you should know there is no option to play out the hand. You get to choose a play on the deal; that's all. But this is a trainer not a game so I think that is perfectly okay. I highly recommend this app for learning the basic Blackjack strategy (i.e. without card counting).

There isn't enough numbers in the numerical system to show my displeasure with this game because you all are thieves. I have reported over 50 issues since I have been playing this game but I have found that issues are glitches and glitches are your way of making money so you cheat to get them. Therefore you make money by cheating. So you have an unlimited number of times people are effected by these cheatches but they don't take the time to write e-mails showing evidence only to be denied money or compensation thereof. For those like me who do write you just say you're working on it but we've lost money coins ink drops games ranking and time. You have lied and told me no-one else has experienced this when I have screen shots to prove they have. Sometimes you do give coins or ink drops. But for example if you give me 35 00 inkdrops when I used coins to buy the inkdrops and I've lost coins as well; you have not sufficiently reimbursed. me AND YOU HAVEN'T FIXED THE PROBLEM that caused me to lose: TIME GAMES RANKINGS INKDROPS COINS AND MONEY! Then you don't fix the problem. So if you replace coins and inkdrops but fail to solve the issues that created the glitches that caused me to LOSE: TIME GAMES RANKING TOKENS INKDROPS COINS and MONEY you haven't REIMBURSED me AT ALL because those problems are still occurring. Then when those same problems occur that you reimbursed me for but I still have receipts and evidence for the new CHEATCHES yet  I'm still losing GAMES TIME RANKINGS INKDROPS COINS and MONEY from the new CHEATCHES and you REFUSE to REIMBURSE me again for ANY and EVERYTHING I've lost...IT'S INTENTIONAL! If it's INTENTIONAL...YOU'RE CHEATING! I just lost a game the score said I won. I bought my boosters But didn't get them and the last game I played the opponents score isn't there. It registers like it's not there and has me locked in my game. So I can either resign the game and lose or wait and waste time until you decide to do something all while my team is losing because I can't play. I find it ironic that starts happening again when we are in a competitive match. You'll say it's unintentional but I know better. YOU CHEAT YOUR PLAYERS TO ENRICH YOURSELVES. I'LL be surprised if you'll even post this. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE DISHONEST A CHEATER AND A THIEF AND I'M TELLING EVERYONE WHO WILL LISTEN! \\ If anyone else is having problems with Ruzzle or MAG and they refuse to reimburse you e-mail ruzzlecheatsyou@gmail.

111178105,50867,ryan.posted,4,2013/5/10,Need more people to have this app!,More people really should download this app and give it a chance. It will be only as good as the people adding NFA businesses and gun friendly businesses. Its only $0.99!! Likes: that I can look and get an idea who has a NFA posted or not and see alternatives. depending on how descriptive the inputters get you can easily see where the signs are posted. Dislike: every time you add a listing you have to input a usename and email address. What I'd like to see:  1. where I can sign in so it can automatically put an email address/user id/etc so I don't always need to input it. 2. if places used to have a sign but no longer we can see that it was listed as a NFA but is now gun friendly/etc. 3. Different font or color for those required right now it shows all the same color so I thought all were required until I just started hitting submit to see if I could get away with a blank space (lat/long email/etc) 4. sort of in correlation with #1 I'd like to see a laptop/desktop portal so you can add/etc from your laptop and desktop and not just your smart phone.,Great feedback and suggestions! On the main page hit About Me to save your name and email; it will be automatically included in any posting. Great idea about different color for Optional items! I will add that feature in next release. Please email me if you have a chance.

113160522,55763,com.valorware.ninthdawn,4,2013/12/15,Great game if you can look past the UI,9th dawn sends you to an open ended world to fight monsters. The game starts great with several quests at hand sadly these become scarce once you get past the first few towns. To counter this the dungeons become far better and completing them is an achievement on it's own. Past the great controls and vast world the problem comes with the UI on newer phones things look really small even with low-res option disabled some boxes may be difficult to click which becomes a problem when choosing spells.,The new engine that we made for the sequel (and to remake the original) will hopefully solve all of the UI and control woes so keep an eye out for that next year.,2013/12/20,Alejandro Castro,others,others,material,material,,,0

96194557,11214,air.com.stoicstudio.BannerSaga,3,2017/9/22,,First of all I love the game. I would much rather there be more awesome $10 games in the app store than the hundreds of $1 bejeweled clones. The Banner Saga is an amazing game... when it works. It would appear that the window Versus Evil added for Google Play integration causes the screen to refresh improperly. Whenever I suspend/resume the phone or disconnect/reconnect from the internet the game comes up fine for a second then the Connected to Google Play window pops up then the screen appears to turn landscape then portrait orientation and the screen refreshes to black. The problem is that only some of the game is redrawn after that. I lose the background the movement range squares and some of the characters and it makes the game unplayable.  If I manage to play an entire level without turning off the device (or having it turn off for inactivity) or disconnecting from the internet then it works fine. I wouldn't mind the refresh problems if reloading was faster but it is rather long. I also wouldn't mind the long load times if suspend/resume worked properly but it doesn't.  FYI I am using a Galaxy Note 3 with Android 5.0,Hi Nathan we appreciate the time you took to let us know you had this issue.

Dragging your way across the main UI during gameplay requires a degree in micro-management timing and pin-point finger accuracy. You will often be undermined at vital moments by the distance needed to drag a new character into the field or the miniscule upgrade buttons. The game is also pretty glitchy on my Galaxy S6 as more than once it has frozen near the end of the level.,Hello please email us with more details of your crash if you wish to troubleshoot! We've tested the game on many devices but there are always others and isolated cases we'd like to solve it for you :) As for the gameplay there are a few modes to cater to players who prefer to/not to micro-manage etc. You can try out some of the simpler modes!,2016/5/25,Bulat Jdanov,others,others,material,material,,,0

I sent this link to my entire party and told them to buy it. I'm telling you now buy it. If your party is like mine your... medicine... can slow gameplay down. You're constantly having to remember what numbers you're supposed to add for what attacks and how the way of the open palm works and and and and. The ability in this app to create a custom attack and keep a log of it to pull up whenever you want is the best feature of this app. You pull up the attack it says what to roll the numerical value to add to it what to roll for damage and the numerical value to add to it.  It's very handy. The way the note feature is set up is great. Everything is great. I'd like to see the ability to add a picture to characters in the future.  This app is amazing.

There are very few actual apps that are actually transparent. There is a link to a complete list in the description so make sure you read that. Most of the transparent ones are bits of the system like settings dialer and calculator. This does not imply any misrepresentation by the developer just don't expect that your apps will use the wallpaper as a theme.  On the other hand it looks quite cool and it doesn't mess up anything making for one of the least painful substratum installs.,Hi I'm sorry about the issues about the notifications texts but some of them can't be themed on stock roms (feel free to contact me anyway).

Very few apps can take a zip of all your current icons to send to the dev for future icon additions. Highly recommend this pack it is well worth the money. Additionally if you find that you're missing an icon I've found the best solution is to just edit the current icon for that app and change it to one of the single-lettered placeholder icons. For instance I use a P for my local bank that starts with a P because there is no way a developer would have a huge demand for that app. It keeps your homescreen looking neat and pretty :),Thanks for the info!

The developer's website shows a picture of a square smartwatch with a very nice interface that has a large easy to read font with codes in a nice list format but there is no way that I can see to make this appear on my watch.

It is so finicky and I have yet to be able to watermark a whole batch of photos for a blog post without needing to relaunch the app a bunch of times because it just stops working. It is an incredibly frustrating experience. Pinching to resize never results in the size you want...as soon as you let go your watermark invariably increases in size. Pinching to resize also results in your watermark rotating EVERY. TIME. so you have to spend time making it straight again. The opacity buttons are extremely insensitive - half the time they work a quarter of the time you click and nothing happens and the other quarter of the time the opposite of what you want happens. It is just a really frustrating app and makes watermarking your photos take WAY more time than it should.,Hi We are extremely sorry for your bad experience all the issues that you mentioned have been duly noted and forwarded to our skilled development team we hope that next time we will come up to your expectations.For more assistance please feel free to contact us at ezywatermark@whizpool.com.

103321172,30241,com.limbicsoftware.towermadness,2,2013/12/30,Spend your time and money on something better,Good: Uses 3D graphics. The game allows you to see which bad guy types will spawn next. Bad: Despite paying for the app you must do in app purchases to unlock all the tower types. While placing a tower you cannot see it's range. The graphical differences between the tower upgrades is non-intuitive / difficult to distinguish. 3D does not make up for the graphics textures being bland and the objects blocky.. The arrows showing the bad guy travel path are not always visible. Bottom line: Buy a better game (such as Defense Zone 2 HD ) rather than spending money on this game plus it's in app unlocks.,Dear Mander  There are over 100 maps to play the majority of them are free. Tap Start Game and tap Add-Ons at the bottom. The IAP map packs are just extras and have a theme (i.e. Halloween Island Space). The special weapons are also not required to beat any of the 100+ maps.

What makes it 3 stars is however that it eats a lot of Ram on your phone slowing everything else down which ultimately eats battery like nothing. Because it uses so much Ram  the battery drains and your phone becomes laggy,Hi! This isn't correct using RAM does not use Battery at all on the contrary proper caching avoids CPU use and Battery.
