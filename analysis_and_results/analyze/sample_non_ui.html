no title</br>i have come to appreciate this game as one of best out there. my only problem is some of the more advanced problems without giving explanation. my previous review follows. this game is portrayed as a learning tool. but then they impose v.difficult time limits and penalties for mistakes! learning sudoku is about recovering from mistakes and taking chances when logic is exhausted. loved the automatic notes but there seems to be problem recovering notes after backing up your moves. i finally went to manual notes to be sure of having correct notes -- disappointing.</br>

no title</br>now the game itself is not bad but the game allows a user to attack other users which ca lead to problems. i've just encountered this as i've seen one user sending out troops as far as 100km and this person has over 130k power. the problem with this gameplay is that the stronger schools can easily pick off the weaker schools and prevent us from becoming a stronger school. change this so that only people with a power of 10k to 20k and fight each other.</br>

it's now outdated</br>this app was designed for the 2014 season and as we are less than 2 weeks away from the opening race of the 2015 season this app has not moved with the times. at least formula 1 could update the whole app for each season - would be so much easier and quicker for fans</br>

the bitter and sweet</br>our business is up 300% over last year the same time. i have spent @$1 000 on credits and grossed $12 500 as a result. this is normally our slow season so i didn't really expect much but thumbtack has filled our schedule almost to capacity. that's the sweet part. the better part is these guys dominate google search results. so if you're trying to compete with them on google adwords forget it. thumbtack leads can be flaky. there are a lot of people out there fishing for bids and not serious buyers.</br>

no title</br>fun and and casual yet it has a fairly deep and complex strategy structure to it. good replay-ability with the different levels and styles of play.  however the large map on my lg g4 brings the flagship phone from half a year ago to a screeching halt. if the app doesn't crash it takes 2-3 minutes to complete. this makes plotting courses a major pain.  why still give it 4 stars? because on my 5 year old acer a500 tablet this thing plays like a streamlined beast. it's the best performing application i've run on there in years. it's  <inline style="color:red">slick</inline>  immediately responsive and there isn't any buggy-ness with the rendering. i'm thinking this likely has to do with the pixel count and how much is trying to be drawn the old tablet is only 1280x800 vs 2560x1440</br>

no title</br>the game is good though unfortunately for those of us who live in small towns it is kinda boring. you really need to focus a little more on the rural areas cuz you are severely lacking. my town has about 83 000 people not the smallest town i know. but it seriously has about 12 pokestops spread out a little to far. went to bay area (live in ca) and the stops there are outrageous. also on another note since there seems to be a small focus on the trainer style you may consider new hairstyles because pretty much all the hats look a little weird with the hair up.</br>

love it!</br>this game is addicting! love playing it but it is expensive. they require you to buy items to meet a challenge but most of the time the item is over priced. there really is no way to earn money in the game if you want to play you have to spend real money. that is the biggest downfall of this game. also when we receive style challenges it would be nice to see that the winners actually styled according to what was asked in the challenge.</br>

no title</br>i rarely leave a review but this game is in my top 5 ever played. and i played a lot of them including several moba games. it isn't too much on the pay to play side. in just 8hrs of gameplay i got 10 heroes for free! it is balanced and teamwork matters for a change instead of just solo-tapping to victory. playing the game on 20mbps wifi and i still have a high ms. on cellular its ok but why spend my monthly limited mb when i have wifi in my house? people complain about unbalanced heroes a lot here. there is always a counter for every hero and unlike other moba one hero cant win against an organised team. cheers!</br>

no title</br>should be amazing if i am to belive the reviews here. i myself however couldn't connect it to my setup. since i'm already using unified remote for about everything including kodi going through the trouble of actually getting this remote to work only for its advanced features sadly wasn't worth my time. edit: hi dev. i'm sorry for not liking your app. :( i'm however relieved to see that you've got a lot of happy users and i do assume rightfully so! :) edit2: dear developer this is getting a bit embarrassing. you've got tens of thousand satisfied users. there is no need to get cynical. i make a habit of leaving a review when i uninstall an app in part to let developers know where they lost me. sorry to have mentioned another app's name in the process. nevertheless as a developer when you're granted a peek into the mind of your users you can either complain about the few unwilling to spend their time setting up and reading docs or you can approach the feedback purely professionally and ask yourself if it would be both possible and worth your time to improve their experience. it's up to you. edit3: just to be clear: of course i did try configuring kodi to work with yatse. i did not go into it expecting it to work out of the box. time required to setup and troubleshoot however is something based upon which i will judge your app. you're making this unnecessary personal for my taste so this will be my last reply. all the best.</br>

no title</br>the concept is great if it actually works. the app has issues connecting to the dvr. if it actually connects it constantly freezes or fails to load. the assistance number is no help either because they can't do anything about it. please don't tell me i need the latest firmware. i just bought it and downloaded the app. the first thing they both did was update.  i'm not an idiot and i've already tried the reboot several times. i've also uninstalled and reinstalled the app. this is terrible. don't buy it.</br>

no title</br>so does anyone at android authority know that their app isn't updating anymore? i've reinstalled this app a few times and it's still not working. apperantly quite a few if not all of its other users are having the same issue. honestly i love this app but it's kinda useless if it doesn't show new articles. please attempt a fix for this i would love to be able to read articles right in the app again.</br>

excellent. like hitman go but easier.</br>i got this because i loved hitman go. hitman go is individual challenging puzzles. this is based on the same concept but a continuous adventure game tyle. this is a lot less challenging and does not have the extra challengs which i teally like in hitman as it made the levels replayable to try to get them all. the onlynextra challenge is to find all the relic pieces which are very small so i need glasses to find them.</br>

works even on 2g!</br>hands down the best walkie-talkie app there is. pretty much cross platform (there's even a windows client) and works on slow connections! works great for working with groups or as simple as a household intercom. new features add new functionality but it doesn't degrade the existing experience reliability and performance of the the well established walkie function. don't look anywhere else this is the walkie app you've been looking for.

no title</br>my favorite icons. i have quite a collection and i like these best. they are well designed the  <inline style="color:red">dark</inline>  icons look great with all that  <inline style="color:red">color</inline> .  what i like best about these over other round styles is their use of  <inline style="color:red">color</inline>  for backgrounds instead of white. these look uniform without being boring.  i also like that these icons don't have a border or ring/rim near/along the outer edge. a  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  full of icons with borders all look the same and the border leaves less room for the  <inline style="color:red">icon</inline> . these maximize the space nothing wasted. keep up the great work.</br>

no title</br>i really really love it but there are times when it crashes and i wasn't able to save causing it to just revert back for miles and miles and just now it crashed and delete all my hardwork even if i was able to save.   the longer i used it the higher the risk of it crashing. that actually makes me sad and frustrated. and the auto-save doesn't even work. to the developers i'm suggesting that the user should be able to access the auto-saves because there may be times where the auto-save saves the file after crashing which makes me very frustrated...   until then  i will not use medibangpaint i'm a bit traumatized by the most recent crash.</br>

no title</br>even when playing for awhile you don't earn very much. it's free money so you can't really complain but it seems a little like false advertising. ads make it seem like people are constantly earning a lot of money when in reality only a few are out of the millions playing. if you do happen to win a bit you can't cash it out until a set amount; which is near impossible to reach. however the tickets are pretty fun to play and i like that there aren't an overwhelming amount of ads.</br>

best out there but</br>i wonder why not even a single app in the store doesn't have a quick scroll button (if a word file has say 1000 pages then how would u read say 600th page)  so this and every other app in the store is nothing but just a garbage in this respect but good only for pages upto 10-20 or 30 max. (pdf readers has got this functionality) suggestion :1. quick scroll support in word pdf etc.(much needed) 2. pdf quality is poor not like adobe 3. less ram consumption(if possible) 4. exit button</br>
Index: 3353</br>
no title</br>excellent app just like camera block get pro version for both and stop complaining that you need to manually unmute it for calls that's a good thing otherwise the app would not be 100% secure as it would have exceptions and exceptions can be exploited. this blocks the microphone until told not too. that is its purpose if that's what you are looking for then this is the app you want if not please don't download it then complain that's it's doing its job the way it said it would.. the app is perfect. well done developer.</br>

great though more inaccurate than previously</br>the charts are improved as are range of topics. it's a great motivator. but loses one star here for not being in sync with my s health (samsung note 5). fails to see a sixty minute walk for example. intermittent inaccurate readings then just make the app more humorous (congrats on that two seconds of walking you got in! is a real thing lark said to me). used to be five stars now three.</br>

no title</br>so grindy. if you're not spending money this is the way it works. burn over half your energy getting to a location that in theory has materials you're looking for (according to the list) but upon looting every chest find none of it (doesn't drop from mobs). return home after watching an ad to not wait 30 minutes to start crafting what you're able to with what you did find. rinse repeat. also some of the stuff you can build relatively early you can't do yet because materials aren't in the game (suggestion don't put those in or grey them out until the materials to actually build them are in the game). that being said it's a beautiful game controls are good setting is good. just know what you're getting into. i'm sure if you spend a fair amount of money your experience will be vastly different. i hit level 32 as free to play so it's not like i didn't give it a chance but the loot drop rates for the cost/time to get to the locations that have them are ridiculous. uninstalling.</br>

no title</br>i wonder why you are accepting people's money before verification.i provided my documents and you denied them three times..hey you have to verify my account i need to move my money i can't have it stuck with you while am highly inneed of it..or you can just allow me move it and have yo account back..if i knew it could take forever to verify i should have used another service fo sure..</br>

no title</br>if you're going to play this game you better choose a city with absolutely no one in it or else you're going to get constantly attacked by players who have been in for awhile.  paying for the in game items doesn't help you either since it takes so long to level up and you're always getting attacked so many times you have no resources to upgrade.  i received 58 battle notifications since there are no limits to how many times you can get attacked and other players can just teleport right next to you and attack.</br>

no title</br>*** be warned *** this game has a pay to win model however it also treats paying customers very poorly and the amount you need to spend to really win is in the 1000s. alot of packs are fasley advertised for example get the best gear in the game - you would expect this to include all gear chests but it does not. glacian gear chests were not included as part of the chest options despite nothing mentioned to say they were excluded. even the artwork on the pack showed glacian armour so again falsely advertised. also learned there is a mechanic whereby once you have spent over a certain amount of money the number of points needed to complete any of the teir 3 events move from 5600 to 11600 effectively making it impossible to complete any of the main events unless you buy a pack for each event. also all extra buildings you had paid for and upgraded (monster farm converter oracle temple forge etc ) were given away as freebies for all to obtain and upgrade. this is a big kick in the teeth for those who have paid to have an advtange. be under no illusion the amount you need to spend on this game will be in the 1000s and the gains are very short lived.  very greedy devs</br>

no title</br>been playing this game occasionally in pc since 2012. pc version is amazing but only after being forced by work that prevents me from even being near my pc that i finally tried this mobile version. and its good. not as good as my modpacked worlds in pc but with the recent mcpe 1.7 and 1.8 updates this game version is definitely worth the money. it was actually the first time i played vanilla minecraft since pc released its 1.6 version. a lot of things have been added and changed for the better (except for the fact that notch apples cant be crafted anymore!? seriously!?) . anyway hopefuly the upcoming java scripting will attract the creators of my favorite mods.</br>

good wording poor 'choose your own'</br>as a choose your own adventure type stories i expected more a lot more. these are a series of novels that expect you to follow their narrow course or die. the characters often did not have choices that reflected their personality or the most logical answer for that character meant death. well written can be used to describe most of them and others are so corny i barely got past the intro before closing the story in disgust. if you want a good read it is here. if you want a say in the story go elsewhere.</br>
