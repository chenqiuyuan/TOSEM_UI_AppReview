buggy slow inefficient</br>i was hoping to use this to take notes on pdf slides (of powerpoints) for classes. the trial version seemed okay at a quick test so i bought the full version.  as soon as i started using the full version it suddenly told me i couldn't make changes to the pdf's any more. it gives me an error failed to save document when i try to save a copy with the notes/markups. i can't find any  <inline style="color:red">resolution</inline>  too this error so it just means that the app is rendered non-functional. this is incredibly frustrating since it worked in the trial version. i paid money for the app to stop working. great. next applying markups or notes is tedious. there is no eraser function for a stylus you have to either undo it or delete the whole batch of lines and start over. adding notes or markups is slow and frequently crashes the app.  all in all this has only proven to be a pdf viewer with no further functionality for me. why anyone would pay for such a simple viewer when you can get better ones for free is beyond me.</br>

...well actually 4 & 1/2 stars...</br>the only negative comment is that i don't consider this  <inline style="color:red">intuitive</inline>  at all. i'm still struggling to adapt the conventions and usage protocols to what i've been used to with other programs apps etc. however; that being said this is a far more flexible and useful outliner -like app than any other one out there. it does all of the things that normal outlining apps do except that it adds some additional functionalities that convert it into more than just an outliner app. the biggie is the ability to link almost any branch to almost any other branch at any location. this means you can create outlines as large as as complex as you want and still be able to see the big  <inline style="color:red">picture</inline>  simultaneously with working with the detail view. with just a little creative thinking you can then turn this app into a task manager to-do list long-range planning tool inventory tool status-tracker etc. etc. the other goodie is the ability to format the text of the notes with things like bold italics bullets etc. not only does this make it customizable to the individual but it supports the ability to do more than just outlining by allowing further distinguishing between branches. get it.</br>

no title</br>this app is great for our small business. i love all of it's choices! i'm giving 1 star so you'll see my review and fix the issues. then you will get 5! the only problems i have are... 1.) many of my employees cannot clock in because it says they are not in the right location however they are in our building when it gives that notice. please fix location sync! 2.) the set my availability  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  comes up on startup. my availabipity is set. i don't need thst part open. then i have to click set my availability  set open availability again because it deletes them all and then go about my business. please fix it! 3.) drains my battery. thr whole reason my employees have this app is because we use our phones all day in our routine. we run around constantly and therefore cannot plug our phones in for long amounts of time. we were doing fine until we downloaded this app and now all of our phones are dying quickly. please fix it!!!</br>

no title</br>this review is in regards to the app not the content. the content is great. the app sucks. using a samsung galaxy 6. it pauses frequently because it does not buffer enough. it gets stuck all the time with videos going out of sync with audio. it does correct itself though. the biggest problem is you can't just close it. if you don't back out to the home  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  the next time you open it the video will run without controls. to get controls back you have to crash and wipe the cache. even when you back out it sometimes loads improperly and you can not sign in.</br>

not  <inline style="color:red">intuitive</inline> </br>the  <inline style="color:red">gui</inline>  changes are not very  <inline style="color:red">intuitive</inline> . e-deposits are easier but having it default to an account rather than confirm the deposit account makes for easy mistakes. also the funds transfer (which i had to do after e-depositing to the wrong account) was not easy to find. a $ button does not mean much to me.</br>

great gameplay glitchy  <inline style="color:red">interface</inline> </br>once you get into a game it works flawlessly but there are a number of other problems before then: 1) fairly often when i start the game it simply crashes at the loading  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline> . 2) the main  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  allows you to tap  <inline style="color:red">interface</inline>  buttons while it's still loading but simply ignores these taps until it's ready. 3) if you play an online game and return to the game select  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  tapping a different game will appear to select a different game to play but actually still has the previous game selected. you have to wait until it's finished loading and tap that game again otherwise you're entering your previous game in spectator mode. 4) i can't find a way to change my online name. i've emailed team 17 twice about these issues and haven't heard back from them.</br>

new app is invasive & annoying</br>i finally had to uninstall this app after the new version was released. not only does the app want control of too many aspects of your phone (that it doesnt need to operate correctly) but the videos needlessly play and there is an overkill on ads. add to that the inability to really control app notifications. the new  <inline style="color:red">layout</inline>  of news is horrible too. the old app actually had a better arrangement/ <inline style="color:red">layout</inline> . nbc is forcing themselves down your throat. i've gone back to using the abc philly app.</br>

the most addictive and engaging app for all kinds of runners</br>this app has brought me closer to running and truely being engaged with my performance at levels only pro atheletes could envisage just a few years ago. i am not a professional just an afficonado. this app has helped me gauge my running in ways i could only dream of and that too with a beautiful  <inline style="color:red">interface</inline>  and clutter free placement of the most relevant specs. accuracy consistency ease of use relevance and most importantly meaningful feedback this app bundles it al. and the cloud sync feature is to die for. have been using it for a year now. i am facing an issue currently dealing with the time stamp to which my runs are tied. it is not the time according to my time zone hence my runs are getting logged at incorrect timings. kindly look into it.</br>

be aware of its limitations !!!!!! disappointed.</br>imagine a situation: you have the same files on your sd card and your cloud service provider like dropbox but with some timestamp difference (many reasons for that). how it will work in case of dropsync ? it will simply work it will notice that all the files are the same and that's it. and in case of foldersync ? you can forget about it you need to redownload/reupload all your files otherwise you will get 'conflicting modifications' errors !!! it sounds like a joke but it works like that. besides that it has some huge problems with instant uploads and auto syncing - sometimes it's not working or gets into autosync loop when it keeps syncing the same folder in 1 minute intervals despite 1 hours autosync interval set. i really don't understand the logic behind some of its actions. this file manager is also very irritating i'm not sure what is this for as i have never used it but it is very poor and is run at start by default. the  <inline style="color:red">ui</inline>  is also one big misunderstanding very  <inline style="color:red">unintuitive</inline> . sync is also slower than in dropsync. overall i'm really disappointed and i recommend dropsync if you use dropbox. it has less features but is much more stable faster predictible and intelligent.</br>

not useful</br>the ordering was quick and easy. however the location did not have my item available so the pick up receipt just said not available  i'm sorry . i wasted my time going up there. i had to seek a refund at which point i was informed that they do not prepare based on the app and that because of the item i should call and never use the app. so the according to the store  the app is completely useless when it comes to actually getting your food. i'll be uninstalling.</br>

pretty good</br>the reason i'm giving 4 stars is due to the lack of advanced profiling and  <inline style="color:red">usability</inline> . i wouldn't mind if you'd add on a widget for switching profiles (notification center launcher). also i'd like for more advanced profiles. i have 2 profiles that i use power save and performance. multiple parts need to be activated one for  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  on one for  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  off. you should add on folders that you can put profiles in so they can be activated at once. also apply this to the n.c and launcher widget if you do this.</br>

no title</br>an actual review to interrupt all of the wonderful meme reviews. this loses points for requiring so much work to enable instead of chrome gotta disable chrome which is built in to so many roms hope nothing re-enables it and then enjoy a tiny bit less ram usage because bloated chrome isn't running in the background. that's really all this is for. running instead of chrome whenever an app displays a web wrapper. or your phone pulls up a  <inline style="color:red">webpage</inline>  to ask you to log in to wi-fi. normally it loads chrome up without most of the  <inline style="color:red">interface</inline>  and just shows the pages there. this is what android used to use before 7.0. if you want to try it for yourself if and only if you use a browser other than chrome normally just disable it in its app info  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline> . webview should enable automatically and then you should update it here. oh and for some reason this thing defragmented all of my mechanical storage dusted my furniture and folded my laundry. can't explain that.</br>

no title</br>it's fun and exciting but there is a considerable amount of lag you have to deal with! but its located in japan so it is understandable. you end up spending a lot of money on trying to win a prize because normally you can't just play once and win you have to usually knock a prize into the hole so you have to play over and over moving it closer and closer until you win and the crane is extremely weak! i havent seen it really pick anything up honestly. i did win a large plush though i spent about 50-60 bucks trying to do this. it's addicting like gambling so play at your own risk. i couldn't stop playing because i didn't want to spend all this money just to quit when i've almost got it..</br>

no title</br>although this is a great app i can only give it 3 stars because of several problems using it on android 8 (oreo) the app works well and gives good turn by turn voice guidance however on the android head-unit in my car the voice guidance breaks up and crackles. it seems to be a common problem with using this app on oreo based android head units. and it won't even start the phone where i've installed an oreo rom (unofficial lineage) but works great on my other phone which runs lineage 7.</br>

by far the best  <inline style="color:red">photo</inline>  app</br>this has almost all the tools of a desktop  <inline style="color:red">photo</inline>  editor. very powerful and very natural feeling for touch devices. no real flaws to speak of.</br>
Index: 964</br>
no title</br>i wanted was a tool that could focus correctly in low light. my new xiaomi mi max 2 camera has middling specs especially compared to the overall hardware quality but it doesn't even deliver middling performance. meanwhile this app was revelatirt. i could read every word on a printed page sitting on my desk in the semi  <inline style="color:red">dark</inline> . major score .... much better than the custom port i tried of google pixel camera which would have been good enough except performance was buggy. as for the ads: they are not terrible and what's more you get the app ad free for watching five brief videos. four were 30 secs. one was 60 seconds. i would have paid for it had there been such an option so i am glad there wasn't. three minutes time for this app is a steal! excited to check out the featured and curious why it focuses this well. i have tried tons of camera appspaid and free that don't even come close. ps why do developers who create camera and gallery apps persist in identifying said apps as simply 'camera' and 'gallery' to the android os? guys don't you realize this makes it impossible to choose your app to be the system default or even differentate when we are faced with a choice of apps to 'open with'?</br>

Index: 966</br>
no title</br>it's a waste of money they only charge for it because it has no ads... it's just a normal web browser therefore a waste of money because devices usually already have a web browser! like this review if u agree! edit: the free puffin web browser is officially the best web browser for mobile! puffin has a flash player of its own & it has great features such as a mouse with an onscreen trackpad a button to let you manually open the keyboard (especially helpful when the keyboard doesn't pop up when it should) a bar that stays above the keyboard with buttons such as 'select all' 'copy' 'paste' & 'cut' as well as a 'gamepad' which isn't very useful or functional and needs some work but u can assign any key on a physical keyboard including arrows to the buttons of the gamepad.</br>

no title</br>there are elements of this game that i like over  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  home. for example the voting process on this game is more fair. in  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  home it makes you choose between 2 designs and whichever  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  you have chosn that score goes up and the other score goes down. which isn't fair when both designs are equally good. if you chose to no vote for either both scores go down. in this game you see one  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  at a time and either dislike or like it. the person's score then goes either up or down based on the vote. also when you vote in  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  home you earn keys but it maxes out at 75. so there is no insensitive to keep voting until you need more keys. in this game you just purchase the hearts you need. voting is not a requirement i do it because i want my designs voted on so it seems fair to vote on other designers.</br>

no title</br>i'm not gonna rate this game compared to the old one but as a stand alone game it's ok the controls are pretty good the stories aren't really anything special. the chat is very improved but it's way too censored i tried to ask someone to come do a dance battle with me and it was censored. so i don't really like that. now the clothes creator is really neat very  <inline style="color:red">easy to use</inline>  and allows your penguin to be very customizable. the addition of disney clothes that you can buy from the start is great however i feel like they should've had more classic characters such as mickey mouse disney princesses now granted there are some disney princesses but not a lot you only see the latest additions such as tangled and frozen no classics. as for the membership it's reasonable but a little pricey imo i could see $3/mo not $5/mo. as for the island itself it's nothing special there's not many places to go not much to do. it can get very boring. now i know i said that i wouldn't judge this game based on the original but i need to say one thing it's no excuse to cancel the original. the original was 100 better. just had to get that out. i think that about wraps up everything. thanks for reading.</br>

no title</br>the app sounds good but there is something very confusing so many restaurants are not at the right location as indicated on the uber app but some of us know the restaurant locations already but whenever someone want to start delivery the app will tell you that you are not at the right location you either navigate or cancel the delivery while you already picked up the food it so harmful for the customers.</br>

no title</br>it's hard to imagine a transit app being more badly designed if they tried. this should be thrown out and rewritten from scratch. can't do many basic things in this app without a great deal of working around the lazy  <inline style="color:red">design</inline> </br>
Index: 1203</br>
no title</br>the new updated app is absolutely awful i miss the old one because it worked better even if it had a basically  <inline style="color:red">design</inline>  and wasn't as fancy as this new one it was much easier to contact people and see who is actually online from nearest to farthest. i was going on a lot more dates and meeting a lot more people and it was way easier before the update. i won't be updating my subscription on here again unless they actually fix this and make it more functional add the messenger feature back and make it work better and is more reliable. but this new updated app is absolutely terrible. i would not waste my money on it. also there seems to be a lot more scammers on here than ever before.</br>

no title</br>top quality audiobook player-- especially if you have your own content it works way better than anything i have previously used. i come from the iphone environment and have always been frustrated by the lack of  <inline style="color:red">easy to use</inline>  drag and drop functionality. now i have that. i don't have to designate files as audiobook. i just open the folder and play. the resume feature-- the most important feature works flawlessly (one week so far)-- not always true with iphone and there are all kinds of added features...definite top quality product. the app shows that this is someone that cares about audiobooks and likely listens to them too.</br>

no title</br>update 11/9/17: bluetooth functionality has improved and all information now displays in car dash. downloads have only shown errors now and no longer download because of songs stuck in the queue (no way to access what is/isn't downloading to cancel because an error  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  shows now).  original review: great app have been a napster/rhapsody customer for years now. two things could use improvement for five stars: would like for mobile downloaded playlists to automatically add individual songs to library and for bluetooth to push through artist and song titles when connected to cars (been in several cars and only song name gets pushed through to in-car dashboard).</br>

no title</br>nice combination idle game / rpg. i love that you have to work it all out as you go. problem is you do have to fight the same battles way too many times. and there doesn't seem to be any point in starting over. it also has display issues: 1. there needs to be an option to display x significant digits using abbreviations e.g. 10m instead of 1000000 - carefully counting digits and watching numbers dance as they change their number of decimal places gets tiresome really fast. 2. numbers overlap with text sometimes making them totally unreadable. 3. number text gets *really* tiny sometimes. it's not really made for small screens (!)</br>

no title</br>a well thought out method and  <inline style="color:red">interface</inline>  i can see it working for most people. not for me for some reason i can't really see what some of the pictures have to do with the words they represent but this is personal nothing against drops. the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is the pricing. they too push the annual over the monthly pricing and the latter is expensive. i mean if they can lower the annual cost to $39.96 that'd be $3.33 a month then why's the actual monthly price still at $9.99?</br>

no title</br> <inline style="color:red">easy to use</inline>  loads of choice including unexpected stuff like the comic books from tv shows such as buffy & twd.  there's also the regular books but it's so much easier to be able to carry a few ebooks on my phone tablet or pc & know they're all synced & i can pick up & read from whichever page i left it on in a different device.  now with the family library sharing option i can share with my daughter (despite her having an iphone) lol what's not to like   </br>

didn't work out for me</br>shipping times where horrible but the biggest disappointment was when i tried ordering clothing. i was very careful to use the size chart and even sized up an entire size just to be sure the items would fit. i was so disappointed to find that their sizing was so far off that i thought maybe my order had been mixed up with someone else's. nope. just an expensive mistake on my part for actually believing & following the sizing guidelines. one i won't be making again.</br>

brilliant shopping app for android</br>coming to android from a nokia with symbian was a slight culture shock and it took me a while to find a shopping app which worked as well as the symbian one i'd been using for a year or so. i trawled through so many droid shopping apps i was almost going to give up and resort to pencil and scraps of paper. then i discovered mighty grocery lite . at first it seemed a bit over the top for a simple shopping list but as i became used to it and found my way around i got to the point where i just couldn't do without it. some of the features are not available in the lite version and i had got to the point where the extras would be really nice so i bought the full version. i wasn't disappointed and in retrospect would have paid much more for this app. i'm still learning all it's ins and outs (thanks to the in depth user guide on their site) and as yet haven't found anything i would like it to do that it doesn't already do. the recipe function is a real blast. want moroccan lamb tagine tonight? go to the recipe section (which you will have already filled in with the ingredients) - select all and there they are in your current shopping list - outstanding. i highly recommend this</br>

incredible!</br>i've used several different launchers over the past couple of years. this is by far the most hands down  <inline style="color:red">user friendly</inline>  system. clean simple easy to set up. awesome work apex! --- ( see i told all of you that it would get updated it did it's fixed. i believe they should take away the ability for us to take away ratings the way we do. i find that just because some change is made and it's not instantly fixed people come here immediately just to harass the developers. everyone can make a mistake this person has to work on an app that will get tried on devices i'm certain they do not own or have access to. because there are so many different android devices. this is the only reason apps on the app store with apple are better they only have one device to worry about. devs here have it harder as they have several! keep that in mind the next time you want to throw a fit about something not working after an update. if it's a reputable developer they will have it fixed asap especially if it's one you pay to use. they're not here to lose customers or make enemies..... )</br>

no title</br>i think this is a good music player that could be a great music player. first off the actual review. this player is great. it does exactly the things i'd like it to. it has a wonderful  <inline style="color:red">ui</inline>  and never bugs out (at least for me on the lg g4). i think a few features are left desired however. specifically customization. i like that we have a few themes to choose from and then the ability to make our own but i'd like the ability to make the playlist art whatever  <inline style="color:red">image</inline>  i want like in spotify. i'd also like for more organization customization like choosing what tab to default to and how playlists are organized. i don't like having to scroll through my playlists rather than just seeing and using the most recent ones show up at the top of i'm making playlists. anyways still a good app that can be made great.</br>

no title</br>sorry this won't be short!! i received a text stating that someone sent me $. i attempt to retrieve the funds but to no avail. i only bank with credit unions and when i put my information in it gave me an error message. i tried to retrieve with a different account and it would not scan the cards etc. i called zelle to find out why i was receiving the error message and i was transferred to the 2nd level tech peopl (well that's what i was told). i sat waiting for 50 minutes and no one ever picked up the call. music and advertisements played the entire time. the next morning i tried again and another 30 minutes on hold no one answered etc. i had them on speaker as i waited for them to answer. no clue no answers and for this reason not impressed. zelle is garbage as far as i am concerned and should have just stated that they weren't doing business with a number of banking institutions as of now. fir tjis reason stop allowing people to send their $ if the recipients aren't going to be able to receive the funding due to not banking with specific banks. oh..one of my credit unions is a well...known cu that military members and their families utilized. very reputable cu. so this was perplexing. also it's taking up to two weeks for the $ to be returned to the sender. ridiculous!!! wasted time and useless. poor customer service..</br>

good app with a little room for improvement</br>this app has come a long way since i first used it. it's likely built as a web app ... probably apache cordova ... responsiveness could use a little attention but not much else. good features and  <inline style="color:red">navigation</inline> .</br>

no title</br>i see y'all had my other review deleted so i'll make another (: the people that run this app are a bunch of crooks. i had pictures saved with this app before you had to pay to play and without warning they started charging for the app and unless you pay their fee you can't access your photos anymore. should be considered extortion.</br>

i loved it before now its only ok.</br>hey guys i absolutely love google calendar. the service is excellent and having it sync everywhere makes organizing my calendar easy. i am disappointed with the new update. whilst visually the app is stunning its removed the seven day outlook which was a brilliant feature for my planning routine. i realize i can see this when turning my device sideways but its just not the same. additionally i can't zoom in or out of my calendar anymore by using pinch to zoom which made planning easier. love the  <inline style="color:red">design</inline> !</br>

no title</br>this is the most amazing migraine tracking app i've ever come across and it is a testament to the compassion of the developers that they continue to charge nothing for it so that it is easily accessible to anyone who may need it. the only thing i would love to see in the future is maybe the creation of a widget? to keep on your home  <inline style="color:red">screen</inline>  so you can log your migraine (at least the basics) on the run when your in a hurry..</br>

no title</br>the app used to be great. now it's buggy & freezes & just worth bothering with..except it's one salvation in my opinion. is that it was good. but now they messed it up. i uninstalled & will reinstall to give it a second chance. but if that doesnt work it will be goodbye tv guide.</br>
