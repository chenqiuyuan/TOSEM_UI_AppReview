## Dataset

* We provide the annotated dataset that our work produced in `data` folder. We also release several example data in this folder.

* The raw data (all collected app reviews) is too large to upload. We introduce the process of selecting UI-related in the paper. We also release the pre-processing record in the `analysis_and_results` folder.

### Empirical Analysis

* We collect most of our empirical analysis scripts, including category counting and statistical analysis.They are put into the `analysis_and_results` folder.

* Some early analysis of this study was performed manually, so there are no corresponding analysis scripts.

### User Study

We release the email content and the analysis results of the user study of Fdroid users in the `"user study"` folder

## Highlight

One of the core contributions of this paper is the taxonomy of UI issues in app reviews. We hope the taxonomy can support more research and practice. Please refer to the taxonomy in the paper and the Chinese version [UI类别（中文）](UI类别（中文）.docx).
